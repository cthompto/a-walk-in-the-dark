When I transitioned, I was told
that the night was no longer mine.
That I should avoid going out alone
in the dark.
But I want it back, my late walks
in the dark.

Every unknown is tinged with fear.
Each dark corner and passage looms.

I want to loom there too, 
with the dark as an unknown equal.

To known is not to be loved
or respected.
To be known is to be dragged
kicking and screaming
into the burning violent light.
No, I will stay here in darkness.
